    By going to this website you have exposed yourself to malicious software. 
    As a result I now know a lot about you... Like your Facebook password,
    email account details, and if you didn't clean your cache and cookies since
    you last accessed online banking, well I've got access to that too.
</p>
<p>Have a nice day ðŸ˜‚</p>
